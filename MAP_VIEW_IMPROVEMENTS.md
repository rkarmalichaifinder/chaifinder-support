# Map View Clustering Improvements

## Problem Identified
The original map view had poor UX where locations that were close in proximity were not visible at certain zoom levels due to:
- Hard-coded clustering disabled (`dynamicDistance = 0.0`)
- Poor zoom-based clustering thresholds
- Annotation overlap at certain zoom levels
- Missing adaptive clustering logic

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Zoom-Based Clustering
Replaced the hard-coded clustering with adaptive clustering that adjusts based on zoom level:

```swift
private func calculateDynamicDistance(for mapView: MKMapView) -> Double {
    let zoomLevel = mapView.region.span.latitudeDelta
    
    if zoomLevel <= 0.001 {
        // Street level - no clustering, show all individual locations
        return 0.0
    } else if zoomLevel <= 0.005 {
        // Neighborhood level - minimal clustering (~0.5m)
        return 0.000001
    } else if zoomLevel <= 0.02 {
        // District level - light clustering (~2m)
        return 0.000005
    } else if zoomLevel <= 0.05 {
        // City area level - moderate clustering (~5m)
        return 0.00001
    } else if zoomLevel <= 0.1 {
        // City level - aggressive clustering (~10m)
        return 0.00002
    } else if zoomLevel <= 0.5 {
        // Metropolitan level - heavy clustering (~50m)
        return 0.0001
    } else {
        // Regional level - maximum clustering (~100m)
        return 0.0002
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Annotation Visibility
- Set `displayPriority = .required` for all annotations
- Improved marker sizing and prominence for clustered annotations
- Added visual feedback with animations and scaling

### 3. Annotation Overlap Prevention
New method `handleAnnotationOverlap` that:
- Identifies annotations in close proximity
- Applies small offsets to prevent overlap
- Ensures all nearby locations remain visible

### 4. Improved Clustering Refresh
- Reduced debounce time from 800ms to 600ms
- More responsive zoom change detection (5% vs 10%)
- Better annotation visibility enforcement after clustering

### 5. Enhanced User Experience
- Clustered markers show count prominently
- Better visual distinction between single and clustered locations
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Debug button (in DEBUG builds) to test clustering

## Key Benefits

1. **Always Visible**: Nearby locations are now always visible at appropriate zoom levels
2. **Adaptive**: Clustering automatically adjusts based on user's zoom level
3. **Performance**: Optimized refresh logic prevents excessive updates
4. **User Control**: Users can see individual locations when zoomed in, clusters when zoomed out
5. **Visual Clarity**: Better distinction between single and clustered locations

## Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Zoom in/out on the map to see clustering adapt
2. Look for nearby chai spots - they should now be visible
3. In DEBUG builds, use the orange info button to see clustering info
4. Check that annotations don't overlap at any zoom level

## Technical Details

- **Distance Units**: All distances are in degrees (latitude/longitude)
- **Clustering Thresholds**: Range from 0.5m to 100m depending on zoom
- **Refresh Logic**: Debounced to prevent excessive updates
- **Annotation Priority**: All annotations use `.required` display priority
- **Overlap Handling**: Automatic offset calculation for nearby annotations

## Future Enhancements

- Add user preference for clustering aggressiveness
- Implement custom clustering algorithms for specific use cases
- Add clustering statistics to the UI
- Optimize for very large numbers of locations
